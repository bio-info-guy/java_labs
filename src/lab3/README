The ToDo class is a background thread running a timer which helps exits the program after a certain amount of seconds 

Within the AA_quiz class there is a ShutDownHook class which is used to print output once the terminate signal is recieved,
this piece of code was found online (from: http://techno-terminal.blogspot.in/2015/08/shutdown-hooks.html) and modified for use.
